### Profile {#profile}

I'm with the experience in software programming since 2008, Linux system server management since 2012, and Android and embedded systems development since 2013. In 2010, I started to contact with open source projects, and be a user and promoter. Then in 2013, I tried to hold a project with friends in github and be a committer.
I'm a person who agrees with the concept of open source, and full of passion in learning various knowledges.

  Tos_Bot is an Android-based auto-battle bot for Tower of Savior (神魔之塔). There are so much similar tools now, but in 2013.08, much tools worked in PC and forced users to play game in emulator. Even some tools worked in mobile device, they were charged. So we build it ourselves (自幹).
